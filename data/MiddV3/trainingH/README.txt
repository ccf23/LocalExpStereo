For demonstration, please download an example file set (Adirondack) from
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-VxeI7PlJE1eG5GTzVhVlYzRUE/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-NbSStHTw1gnzZJp0sJ7TWg
then extract it here as a directly "Adirondack"

Data for other MiddV3 scenes can be collected from following places.
1. MC-CNN matching cost data (unofficially produced by me): https://github.com/t-taniai/LocalExpStereo#pre-computed-mc-cnn-matching-costs
2. Stereo image pairs and calib data (official): http://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/submit3/
